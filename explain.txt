currentDate: Today's date (day of the month).
birthDetails.date: The birth day of the person.
birthDate, birthMonth, birthYear: Variables to calculate the age.
months: Array containing the number of days in each month.
Example Input:
Suppose today's date is December 31, 2024 (currentDate = 31, currentMonth = 12, currentYear = 2024), and the birth date is February 5, 2000 (birthDetails.date = 5, birthDetails.month = 2, birthDetails.year = 2000).

Step-by-Step Execution:
Compare currentDate and birthDetails.date:

Check if today's day (currentDate) is greater than or equal to the birth day (birthDetails.date).
In this example: 31 >= 5 (true). So, no adjustment to the month is needed, and birthDate is calculated as:
javascript
Copy code
birthDate = currentDate - birthDetails.date; // 31 - 5 = 26
Handle the Case When currentDate < birthDetails.date:

If today's day is less than the birth day, adjust the calculations:

Decrement birthMonth by 1 (i.e., use the previous month).
Add the number of days in the previous month to currentDate to calculate birthDate.
In this case, since currentDate >= birthDetails.date, this part is skipped.

Check for birthMonth < 0:

If the month adjustment results in birthMonth < 0, it means the year needs to be decremented, and birthMonth is set to 11 (December).
In this example, this condition is not triggered since currentMonth = 12.
Display the Result:

Call displayResult with the calculated values:
javascript
Copy code
displayResult(birthDate, birthMonth, birthYear);
Adjusted Calculation Example:
Suppose today's date is January 2, 2024, and the birth date is February 5, 2000.

currentDate = 2, birthDetails.date = 5: 2 < 5 (false).
Adjust month:
javascript
Copy code
birthMonth--; // January -> December
Add the days of December:
javascript
Copy code
days = months[currentMonth - 2]; // days = months[11 - 2] = 31
birthDate = days + currentDate - birthDetails.date; // 31 + 2 - 5 = 28
Check for birthMonth < 0: Not triggered.
Final calculated values:

birthDate = 28, birthMonth = 11, birthYear = 2023.
